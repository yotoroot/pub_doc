## IAAS
IaaS stands for Infrastructure as a Service. It is a type of cloud computing service that offers essential compute, storage, and networking resources on demand, on a pay-as-you-go basis. Customers can use these resources to run and manage their own applications and operating systems, without having to maintain or update their own data center infrastructure. Some examples of IaaS providers are Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, and Google Cloud Platform.
